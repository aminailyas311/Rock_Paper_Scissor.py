The script is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users play against the computer. Users are prompted to input their 
choice of "rock," "paper," or "scissor," or they can enter "Q" to quit the game. The computer randomly selects its choice from the same options. 
The script then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game and updates the scores accordingly. If the user's choice matches the computer's choice,
the game is a tie. After each round, the script displays the computer's choice and updates the scores. The game continues until the user chooses to quit, 
at which point the final scores are displayed, showing how many times the user and the computer won. The game concludes with a "GAME OVER" message.The script is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game
